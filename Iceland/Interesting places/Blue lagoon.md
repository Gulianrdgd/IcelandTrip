## Description
The Blue Lagoon is one of Iceland's most popular attractions, and it's little wonder as to why. The beautiful milky-blue water is unlike anything else found on earth and starkly contrasts with the surrounding black lava fields and creeping gray moss. The temperature of the Blue Lagoon is a consistent 102 F (39 C) year-round, making it the perfect bathing temperature. 

The lagoon is on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwest Iceland, renowned for its barren landscapes and cone-shaped volcanoes. It's only a 14-mile (23-kilometer) drive from Keflavik International Airport. From the Icelandic capital city of Reykjavik to Blue Lagoon is 30 miles (49 kilometers). That makes it the perfect first stop when arriving in Iceland or the last stop before leaving the country.
