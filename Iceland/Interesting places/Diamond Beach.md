## Description
The Diamond Beach is a strip of black sand belonging to the greater Breiðamerkursandur glacial plain, located by Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon on the South Coast of Iceland.

Those who join certain guided packages, such as this 6-Day Summer Ring Road Tour, will have an opportunity to explore it, as will those on self-drive excursions such as this 7-Day Winter Road Trip. It can also be accessed from the Ring Road by those who rent a car.

At the Diamond Beach, the icebergs which fill the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon wash up on shore, creating a stark contrast with the volcanic black sand. This beautiful display makes it a favourite location for photographers and nature lovers. Wildlife enthusiasts also frequent the site as many seals call the beach home, and it is one of the best places in the country to see orcas from the shore.
