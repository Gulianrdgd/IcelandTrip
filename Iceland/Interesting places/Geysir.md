## Description

\#Geysir is a famous hot spring in the geothermal area of Haukadalur Valley, found in south-west Iceland.

Geysir is less than two hour's drive from the capital, making it easily accessible for many joining a [Golden Circle day tour](https://guidetoiceland.is/book-trips-holiday/nature-tours/golden-circle) or those who rent a car. 

Making up just one of the attractions along the world-renowned Golden Circle sightseeing route, alongside [Ãžingvellir National Park](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/thingvellir) and the mighty [Gullfoss waterfall](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gullfoss), Geysir is most well-known for having lent its name to geysers all around the world.
