## Description

This is an amazing and spectacular beach. The cliffs and sea caves with their variety of basalt columns of all sizes and twists are mesmerizing. Look up Tide tables and go around low tide so that you can explore the base of the cliffs safely. And yes, it is dangerous to be near the waves. In early June 2022 another person died.
