## Description

\#Jökulsárlón is #Iceland’s most famous glacier lagoon. Conveniently located in the southeast by Route 1, about halfway between the #Skaftafell Nature Reserve and #Höfn, it is a popular stop for those traveling along the South Coast or around the Ring Road of the country.

As a glacier lagoon, #Jökulsárlón is a lake that is filled with meltwater from an outlet glacier. In this case, it is Breiðamerkurjökull, a tongue of Europe’s largest ice cap, #Vatnajökull. It stands out, however, due to the fact that it also fills with icebergs breaking from the glacier, some of which tower several stories high.
