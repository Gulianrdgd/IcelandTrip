## Description
Svartifoss is best renowned for the hexagonal basalt columns that surround it and lay shattered at its base. These columns, which are very dark, lend the feature its name; Svartifoss means ‘Black Falls’.

The geology surrounding Svartifoss has inspired many artists and architects, spanning generations. To list them all would be impossible, but perhaps the most notable is [Hallgrímskirkja](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/hallgrimskirkja), the largest church in [Reykjavík](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/skaftafell), which took elements of Svartifoss’s columns and Thor’s hammer in its design.

The capital’s National Theatre also drew inspiration from Svartifoss, as did the artwork ‘Milestones’ on [Viðey Island](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/videy), by Richard Sierra.
