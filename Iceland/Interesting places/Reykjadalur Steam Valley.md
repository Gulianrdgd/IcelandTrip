## Description
Reykjadalur or the #Steam Valley is located in the south part of #Iceland just north of the town [**Hveragerði**](https://www.funiceland.is/places-to-go/towns-and-villages/hveragerdi/ "Hveragerdi"). #Reykjadalur is exceptionally beautiful geothermal area with a great deal of hot springs and mud pools. The river that runs down the valley is actually hot in some places so it is possible to dip in, relax and enjoy the stunning nature.

Don't forget to bring a camera and a swimsuit on this hike as it is a unique experience with all the steam rising up all around as you walk and the sound of the boiling hot pools is so relaxing that it makes you want to dip in. The landscape is typical for a geothermal area, very colorful and rich of vegetation and the perfect photo opportunity.

The Valley is accessible all year round but in the winter time it sometimes snows in the mountains so the hike can be difficult but the river is still warm.
