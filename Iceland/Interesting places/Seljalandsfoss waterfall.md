## Description

Seljalandsfoss is a waterfall that can be fully encircled, situated on the South Coast of Iceland with a drop of 60 meters (200 feet).

Many of the vacation packages on offer promise plenty of time at Seljalandsfoss, such as this 6-Day Summer Tour; the same can be said for self-drive holidays, including this 10-Day Road Trip. Those who join a South Coast tour or rent a car can reach the waterfall from the capital in just a couple of hours.

Due to the waterfall’s close proximity to the Ring Road and impressive natural features, it is one of the country's most famous and visited falls. Majestic and picturesque, it is one of the most photographed features in all of Iceland.
