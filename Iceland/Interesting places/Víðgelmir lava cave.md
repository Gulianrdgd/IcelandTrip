## Description
Víðgelmir is perhaps the best preserved cave of the well known caves in Iceland. This is due to ice buildup during the 1960s finally closed off the only access into Víðgelmir in 1972. It was re-opened in 1994 and closed the following year with a metal gate. As such you will still find lava formations that long since have been destroyed in other well known caves.

The Cave Víðgelmir is located in a lava field called Hallmundarhraun, which is the largest lava field in Borgarfjörður. Both the exact starting time and duration of the eruption are not known, but it has been estimated that the eruption lasted 1-4 years and the start of the eruption is usually set at around 900 AD.
