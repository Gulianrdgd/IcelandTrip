## Description

Gullfoss (translated to ‘Golden Falls’) is one of #Iceland’s most iconic and beloved waterfalls, found in the Hvítá river canyon in Southwest #Iceland.

For those who rent a car or take a Golden Circle tour, #Gullfoss waterfall can be reached within two hours from Iceland's capital. Most of the guided packages around the country include a stop at Gullfoss, such as this popular 6-Day Vacation, as do almost all self-drive journeys, like this 7-Day Winter Road Trip.

The water in Hvítá river travels from the glacier Langjökull, before cascading 32 meters (105 feet) down #Gullfoss’ two stages in a dramatic display of nature’s raw power. This incredible site is seen by most visitors, as it is on the Golden Circle sightseeing route.

Because of the waterfall’s two stages, #Gullfoss should actually be thought of as two separate features. The first, shorter cascade is 11 meters tall (36 feet), whilst the second drop is 21 meters (69 feet). The canyon walls on both sides of the waterfall reach heights of up to 70 meters (230 feet), descending into the great Gullfossgjúfur canyon. Geologists believe that this canyon was formed by glacial outbursts at the beginning of the last age.

In the summer, approximately 140 cubic meters (459 cubic feet) of water surges down the waterfall every second, whilst in winter that number drops to around 109 cubic meters (358 cubic feet). With such energy, visitors should not be surprised to find themselves drenched by the waterfall’s mighty spray should they get too close.

As mentioned, #Gullfoss makes up a part of the highly popular Golden Circle sightseeing route, alongside the #Geysir geothermal area and #Þingvellir National Park. Many Golden Circle tours include additional activities that can be taken from Gullfoss, such as ascending the mighty nearby glacier Langjökull and entering its ice tunnels or snowmobiling along its gleaming surface.
