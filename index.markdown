# Welcome

Welcome to the export of my Obsidian vault. This is used to document and help with a trip to Iceland.

## What can I expect?
On this website I will add all sorts of information about every day that I will be in Iceland. This includes the things that I will do, the places that I will visit and the things that I will see. I will also add some information about the places that I will stay at and the things that I will eat. I will also add some information about the things that I will do in the evening.
