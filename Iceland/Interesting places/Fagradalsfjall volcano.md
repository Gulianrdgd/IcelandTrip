## Description

The Fagradalsfjall Volcano is erupting again as of August 3, 2022. We understand very well that a volcanic eruption is an extraordinary sight to see. The early stages of this eruption are very similar to last year's, except further away from the parking area. Authorities have asked hikers to take extra precautions and to pay close attention to the latest

weather and volcanic gas
emissions updates. These conditions, along with the volcano itself, are subject to change rapidly, and note that the area

may be closed due to hazardous conditions!
